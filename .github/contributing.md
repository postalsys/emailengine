# Contributing

## Legal

(agreement below borrowed from [Sidekiq Legal](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/.github/contributing.md))

By submitting a Pull Request, you disavow any rights or claims to any changes
submitted to the EmailEngine project and assign the copyright of
those changes to Postal Systems OÜ.

If you cannot or do not want to reassign those rights (your employment
contract for your employer may not allow this), you should not submit a PR.
Open an issue and someone else can do the work.

This is a legal way of saying "If you submit a PR to us, that code becomes ours".
99.9% of the time that's what you intend anyways; we hope it doesn't scare you
away from contributing.
